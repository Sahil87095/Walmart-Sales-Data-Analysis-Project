🛒 Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis on Walmart sales data using Python and SQL (MySQL). The goal is to extract actionable business insights, uncover customer behavior patterns, and identify opportunities for optimization through end-to-end data processing, cleaning, transformation, and querying.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2
Database: MySQL
IDE: Jupyter Notebook

1. 📦 Install Required Libraries & Load Data
Installation
Install the essential Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Loading the Data
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to perform preliminary exploration and transformation.

2. 🧭 Explore the Data
Objective:
Understand the structure and quality of the dataset before analysis.
Key Actions:
Use functions like .head(), .info(), .describe() for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Check for column names, data types, value distributions, and early insights.

3. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Key Cleaning Tasks:
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate repeated records to ensure accuracy.

Handle Missing Values:
Drop rows or columns with insignificant missing data.
Impute or fill values where necessary.

Fix Data Types: Ensure consistency (e.g., dates → datetime, prices → float).
Format Currency Fields: Use .replace() to clean and standardize price and revenue fields.


5. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
New Feature Created:
Total Amount = unit_price × quantity
Added as a new column for simplified analysis of transaction values.

Purpose:
Enables more insightful aggregation and revenue-related queries in SQL.

7. 🗄️ Load Data into MySQL
Steps:
Set Up SQL Connection: Use SQLAlchemy to connect to MySQL.

Table Creation: Creation of necessary tables.

Data Insertion: Insert the cleaned and enriched data into MySQL tables.
